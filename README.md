Python API Challenge 

Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

Table of contents:

Output Data: contains figures for the scatter plots as well as a csv file for the cities information.

Weather Py: contains the coding and available datasets for the two different files (VacationPy, WeatherPy).

Gitignore: contains file to block api keys.

Read Me: contains all references and sites used in the challenge.
